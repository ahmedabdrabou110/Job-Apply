what is the difference between querySelector and closest?

Both querySelector and closest are methods in JavaScript that allow you to select elements from the DOM

`querySelector` is a method that returns the first element that matches a  CSS selector. so, if you want to select the first element with the class "id", you can use document.querySelector('.id')

closest is a method that returns the closest ancestor element that matches a  CSS selector. This method starts at the current element and looks up the DOM tree, returning the first element that matches the selector

so, if you want to select the first element with the class "id", you can use element.closest('.id')
